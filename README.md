# Codex

A comprehensive collection of Python programming exercises, concepts, and problem-solving practice materials covering everything from basics to advanced topics.

## üë®‚Äçüíª About

This repository serves as my personal learning vault for mastering Python programming concepts. It contains organized code examples, exercises, and projects that cover fundamental to advanced topics including basics, object-oriented programming, data structures & algorithms, and problem-solving challenges.

**Author:** Sirajul Islam ([https://github.com/siraajul](https://github.com/siraajul))  
**Learning Resource:** [Will Be Added Later]

## üìö Topics Covered

- **Python Basics**: Variables, data types, operators, input/output
- **Control Flow**: Conditional statements, loops, exception handling
- **Functions & Modules**: Function definitions, scope, lambda functions, modules
- **Data Structures**: Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, strings
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
- **File Handling**: Reading/writing files, working with different file formats
- **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, sorting, searching
- **Problem Solving**: Coding challenges, algorithmic thinking, optimization techniques
- **Advanced Topics**: Decorators, generators, context managers, regular expressions

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- A code editor or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, or any text editor)

### Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/siraajul/codex.git
   cd codex
   ```

2. **Navigate to any folder and run the Python files:**
   ```bash
   # Run a specific Python file
   python3 filename.py
   
   # Or using python command (if Python 3 is default)
   python filename.py
   
   # For interactive exploration
   python3 -i filename.py
   ```

3. **Explore and practice:**
    - Start with the `basics/` folder if you're new to Python
    - Progress through folders in order: basics ‚Üí control_flow ‚Üí functions ‚Üí data_structures ‚Üí oop ‚Üí dsa ‚Üí problem_solving
    - Read the comments and docstrings in each file
    - Modify and experiment with the code
    - Try solving the exercises yourself before checking solutions
    - Run the code to see outputs and understand behavior

## üéØ Purpose

This repository was created to:

- **Master Python Fundamentals**: Build a solid foundation in Python programming from basics to advanced concepts
- **Practice Problem Solving**: Develop algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills through coding challenges
- **Learn Data Structures & Algorithms**: Implement and understand core DSA concepts for technical interviews
- **Explore OOP Concepts**: Master object-oriented programming principles and design patterns
- **Build Reference Library**: Create a comprehensive collection of Python code snippets and solutions
- **Track Learning Progress**: Document my journey from Python beginner to advanced practitioner
- **Prepare for Technical Interviews**: Practice common coding problems and algorithmic challenges
- **Create Reusable Code**: Build a personal library of Python utilities and implementations
